This is my submission for the Front End Tech Challenge, requested by Varsity Tutors.

## 3rd Party Tools

This app has implemented the following tools...
- AngularJS v1.4.8
- Angular Animate v1.4.1
- Angular Route v1.4.8
- [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)

## Installation

### System Dependencies
The first step is to install the application's dependencies.  They are listed below.

1. Git (only if you're cloning from the repo)
2. Sass (and Ruby)

### Clone the Repo
This can be done using https or over ssh.  I prefer ssh using `git clone git@github.com:deanmono/slurb.git`

### App Dependencies
Move into the projects root directory (`cd slurb`) then install the app dependencies

## Running Locally
Go to the root directory path in a modern web browser or open the index.html file from the root directory
