This is my submission for the Front End Tech Challenge, requested by Varsity Tutors.

## 3rd Party Tools

This app has implemented the following tools...
- AngularJS v1.4.8
- Angular Animate v1.4.1
- Angular Route v1.4.8
- [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)

## Installation

### System Dependencies
The first step is to install the application's dependencies.  They are listed below.

1. An http server
2. Git (only if you're cloning from the repo)
3. Sass (and Ruby for that matter)

### Clone the Repo
This can be done using https or over ssh.  I prefer ssh using `git clone git@github.com:deanmono/slurb.git`

### App Dependencies
Move into the projects root directory (`cd slurb`) then install the app dependencies

## Running Locally
App root will need to be saved to your servers root, then go to the project root directory path in a modern web browser (ie. http://localhost/slurb/)

Viewing the app from file will cause issues in browser due to cross origin security policy. Angular loads views via http.

Alternatively, you can view the project at [http://deanmono.github.io/slurb/](http://deanmono.github.io/slurb/)
